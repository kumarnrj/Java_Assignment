1) What do you mean by a Data structure?

Ans: A data Structure is way of collection of data so that the operation on the data can be performed efficiently.
    i.e insertion, deletion and searching.
    eg. A array is data structure and if we want to insert in the  between an element in th array then we have to shift all the
        element to the right side.
        But if we use LinkedList rather than Array then we do not have to shift the element.


2) What are some of the applications of DS?

Ans: The following are the application of DS
      -> Array
      -> LinkedList
      -> Stack
      -> Queue
      -> Tree
      -> Graph
      -> Hash Table

3) What are the advantages of a Linked list over an array?

Ans: The following are the advantages of a linked list over an array:
     -> Dynamic size  whereas in array the size is fixed.
     -> Deletion and insertion is easy   whereas in array it is a tedious task because we have to shift the element.


4) Write the syntax in C to create a node in the singly linked list.

Ans: Syntax to create a singly linked list node:

       struct Node
       {
            int data;
            Node *next;
       }


5) What is the use of a doubly-linked list when compared to that of a singly
   linked list?

Ans: The following are the advantages of using doubly linked list
      -> It can traverse both side forward and backword.
      -> Deletion can be done very easily if pointer to the node is given.
      -> More efficient than signly linked list for accessing the data.
      -> If we need better performance while searching and memory is not a problem then doubly linked list is very efficient.


6) What is the difference between an Array and Stack?

Ans: The difference between array and stack:-

     -> Stack are based on the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle while array are the based on the index.
     -> Insertion and deletion can be done only from the top of the stack while in array insertiona and deletion can
        be done from any index.
     -> Stack is dynamic while array are fixed in size.
     -> Stack can contain any type data while array can contain only homogeneous data.


7) What are the minimum number of Queues needed to implement the priority
queue?

Ans: The minimum number if Queues are needed to implement the priority queue is 2.
      One queue for storing the element and other one for storing the prioity.


8) What are the different types of traversal techniques in a tree?

Ans:   Types of traversal in tree
       -> preorder   (root,left,right)
       -> inorder    (left,root,right)
       -> postorder  (left,right,root)


9) Why it is said that searching a node in a binary search tree is efficient than that of
   a simple binary tree?

Ans: In a binary Search tree elements are arrange in such a manner that the elements greater than the root element are the
     right side of the tree( right child ) and the elements less than root element are left side of the tree(left child).
     Whereas binary tree doesn't follow the same rule.
     Due the this property of binary search searching is very efficient because because by comparing the root node
     we can reach to the desire location whereas in case of binary tree we have to traverse the complete tree in order
     to seacrh an element in the tree.


10) What are the applications of Graph DS?

Ans:
     -> Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of two(or more) roads are considered
        to be a vertex and the road connecting two vertices is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation system is based
        on the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two vertices.
     -> In Facebook, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then there is an edge running between them.
         Facebookâ€™s Friend suggestion algorithm uses graph theory. Facebook is an example of undirected graph.
     -> In World Wide Web, web pages are considered to be the vertices. There is an edge from a page u to other page v if
        there is a link of page v on page u. This is an example of Directed graph. It was the basic idea behind Google Page
        Ranking Algorithm.
     -> In Operating System, we come across the Resource Allocation Graph where each process and resources are considered to
        be vertices. Edges are drawn from resources to the allocated process, or from requesting process to the requested
        resource. If this leads to any formation of a cycle then a deadlock will occur.



11) Can we apply Binary search algorithm to a sorted Linked list?
Ans:  Yes, It is possible to sort an linked list using binary search because we know the count of the nodes in linked list
      but we can access only one node at a time.



12) When can you tell that a Memory Leak will occur?

Ans: Memory leak can be defined as when  a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory which is no
     longer needed is not released. Memory leak may occur when a object created in the heap and it is not available for garbage
     collector ( the allocated memory to the object is not released ) and it happen frequently that no memory is available.



13) How will you check if a given Binary Tree is a Binary Search Tree or not?

Ans: A binary seach tree has the property that all the element greater than root will be right subtree of BST and
     the elements less than root will be in left subtree. If our binary tree contain such property then we can say that
     the binary tree is a binary search tree.

14) Which data structure is ideal to perform recursion operation and why?

Ans: Stack. Because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property it remembers its 'caller' so knows whom to return when the
     function has to return. Recursion makes use of system stack for storing the return addresses of the function calls


15) What are some of the most important applications of a Stack?

Ans: Applications of stack:
     ->	Expression handling
     ->	To check parenthesis matching.
     ->	Backtracking procedure
     ->	Memory Management.
